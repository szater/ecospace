## Ecospace: R Package for Simulating Community Assembly and Ecological Diversification Using Ecospace Frameworks

ecospace is an R package that implements stochastic simulations of community 
assembly (ecological diversification) using customizable ecospace frameworks 
(functional trait spaces). Simulations model the 'neutral', 'redundancy', 
'partitioning', and 'expansion' models of Bush and Novack-Gottshall (2012) and
Novack-Gottshall (2016a, b). The package provides a wrapper to calculate common
ecological disparity and functional ecology statistical dynamics as a function
of species richness. Functions are written so they will work in a
parallel-computing environment.

The package also contains a sample data set, functional traits for Late 
Ordovician (Type Cincinnatian) fossil species from the Kope and Waynesville 
formations.

The most recent public release of the code is on CRAN at:

http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ecospace

You can install the most recent public release version in R using:

	install.packages("ecospace")

The latest pre-release version can be found at GitHub:
